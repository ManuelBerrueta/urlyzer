# urlyzer
**`urlyzer`** is a tool to help with analyzing URLs, allowing you to quickly dissect and easily visualize all the parameters offline to keep your URL and Params confidential. If you find it useful, consider giving us a ⭐ star 👆 😉

### Why?
There is very often times when you have a really long URL with all kinds of different parameters. When you are trying to analyze the parameters in the query string you may paste it into a text/code editor and break them apart or search for a certain parameter and value. Also, you may often have to decode some of it (if it is URL encoded), which means you have to also copy and paste that to another terminal tool or some other tool like Burp’s Decoder/CyberChef. 

If you are frustrated by this process, often repeated multiple times a day, then this tool is for you!

---    
### Features
- Offline parsing to keep your URL and Query String Parameters confidential.
- Allows you to pipe-in (`|`) the URL from the command line via `stdin`.
- Check the final destination (`-f`) after redirects of a URL.
- **Proxy** (`-p`) to allow to forward proxy the traffic for further inspection to Burp (or your proxy of choice)  . 
- Check Azure Blob Storage SAS URIs (`sas`) for type & parse the parameters with details of what each of those parameters mean in long form.
- Parse cookies 🍪 with `-c`.

## Example use cases:
### Running the tool as a script:
```Shell
go run urlyzer.go "https://www.example.com/path/towin?param1=value1&param2=value%202"
```
### Running the tool from one of the binaries:
**Simple Tool Use:**
```Shell
urlyzer "https://www.example.com/path/towin?param1=value1&param2=value%202#MyFragment"
```
**Piped Input:**
```Shell
echo "https://www.example.com/path/towin?param1=value1&param2=value%202#MyFragment" | urlyzer 
```

### Example Output
```YAML
Scheme: https
Host: www.example.com
Port: 
Path: /path/towin
Query String: param1=value1&param2=value%202
Query Parameters:
  param2: value 2
  param1: value1
Fragment: MyFragment
```

### Running final destination analysis of a URL
This is a case where the URL may have one or multiple redirects and you wish to check it's final destination. 
To do the analysis, pass in the `-f` flag after `urlyzer`:
```Shell
urlyzer -f "https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=lts"
```
**Example Output**
```YAML
Final Destination: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v7.2.13
Status Code: 200
Headers:
  Location: [https://powershell-release-redirect.azurewebsites.net/api/powershell-release-redirect?code=GyM2EB/tN8KmH2swJp/o/TdJ72z9CLP2/g3lBa9gnPWDZOAbDrD5EA==&tag=lts]

```
#### Using the Proxy
If you want to forward proxy the traffic from the analysis for further analysis you can use the `-p` flag follwed by the proxy address:
```Terminal
echo " https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=lts" | ./urlyzer -f -p "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

# Running in a container
Running in a container is easy with the provided Dockerfile and it doesn't any other dependencies, well other than having Docker!
1. Clone the code
2. Build the image by running `docker build --tag urlyzer .`
3. Run the container with `urlyzer`: `docker run urlyzer [flag] "URL"`

## Examples
### Running regular `urlyzer`
`docker run urlyzer "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1234#revx0r.com"`

### Checking final destination/redirects
`docker run urlyzer -f "https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=lts"`
